                                 Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.
                                 <br>
                              

                                Follow these five steps every time.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                               1.Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.
                               <br>
                               2.Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, 
                               between your fingers, and under your nails.
                               <br>
                               3.Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.

                               4.Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.
                               <br>
                               5.Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.

		                		Social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease causing pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease transmission in a community. This eventually leads to decrease in spread, morbidity and mortality due to the disease.

		                		While it may be disappointing to hear that so many sports events, cruises, festivals and other gatherings are being cancelled, there is a public health reason for these measures. These cancellations help stop or slow down the spread of disease allowing the health care system to more readily care for patients over time.

		                		It’s important to understand that even when people appear not to have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), they may still be carrying the virus.  Where you’re meeting people who aren’t from your household, your risk of catching coronavirus can increase depending on the situation. 
		                		<br> 
                                 <br>
                                The European Centre for Disease Control talks about high risk and low risk contacts with other people.  You should take these risks into account when you are thinking about visiting or gathering with other people, in particular the time limits where you may be at a higher risk of catching COVID-19 when spending time with someone indoors.

		                		 With the proper equipment and adjustments, many people can do most or all of their work from home. Your employer should support you to find reasonable adjustments to do this. However, not all jobs can be done from home. If your workplace is open and you cannot work from home, you can travel to work.

		                		If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn’t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example, on public transport or in some shops.
		                		<br> 
                                 <br>
                                Evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you. However, if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms, it may provide some protection for others you come into close contact with.

                               Face coverings do not replace social distancing. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (new cough and/or high temperature and/or loss of smell/taste), you should complete the on line self-assessment tool (covid19.gov.im) and follow the advice given.  If you and your household are advised to isolate at home, you must do so: wearing a face covering does not change this.n.

		                		A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards.
		                		<br>
		                		<br>

                                Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of 2 or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly. For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.
                                <br>
		                		<br>

                                 It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.
